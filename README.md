# RemasteredCalculator

this is a basic functioning calculator written in Swift. 

I have a working calculator on the app store https://github.com/rpcarson/RetroCalculator which was written 3 months after beginning to learn swift. This project accomplishes the same functionality but the code has been refactored, rewritten and condensed to a great degree. It is much more readable and concise, and shows quite clearly an evolution in my code architecture and data modeling.
